# The algorithm works by calculating a histogram of the image's pixel intensities and then iterating through all possible threshold values to calculate the variance 
between the two classes of pixels. The threshold value that maximizes the variance is chosen as the optimal threshold.

# Mathematically, Otsu's method can be formulated as follows:
- Calculate the histogram of the input image.
- Normalize the histogram so that it represents a probability distribution.
- Calculate the cumulative sum of the normalized histogram.
- Calculate the cumulative means of the two classes separated by each possible threshold value.
- Calculate the between-class variance for each possible threshold value using the cumulative sum, cumulative means, and total mean.
- Choose the threshold value that maximizes the between-class variance.
